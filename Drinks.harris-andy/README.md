# DrinksInfo_cSharpAcademy

This is my submission for the cSharpAcademy Drinks Info project found here: [Coding Tracker Project](https://thecsharpacademy.com/project/15/drinks)


## Project Description
- A small app using HTTP requests in which the user can view drink recipes pulled from an external API.
- Built with C#/.Net 8, Spectre Console


## Usage
- Follow the instructions and away you go. Choose a drink category then choose a drink to see the recipe.

## Features

- Data is pulled from here: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

## More to do
- Could add a main menu with options for random drink or giving users option to type in a drink name without using menus.


## New Stuff & Things I Learned.
- First time using HTTP requests and parsing JSON objects in C#.
- Created a custom JSON converter to deal with Ingredients and Measures (used AI help - yeah I know but I did learn).


## Questions & Comments
- I left this synchronous but I plan to switch to async in the next project.
