# Drinks-Info.Lawang
This application is connected to an external API through HTTP requests using .NETâ€™s class library. 
we use Restsharp nuget package to handle requests and response and Newtonsoft.json to deserialze the response we get from API.


## Requirements
- Their drinks menu is provided by an external company. All the data about the drinks is in the companies database, accessible through an API.
- This console app allows the users to pull data from any drink in the database.
- When the users open the application, they should be presented with the Drinks Category Menu and invited to choose a category. Then they'll have the chance to choose a drink and see information about it.

## Features
* No database is utilised here.
* Uses RestSharp package for handling requests and response.
* Uses Newtonsoft Json for deserializing data.

## Project Summary
#### What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

* I didn't know how to send Http request to the api, so i had to learn about that, and found out there is even easier way to do that via using RestSharp
package, so I used that for this project.





## ðŸ›  Skills Learned
#### REST-SHARP
* Using RestClient and RestRequest from RestSharp package to handle request and response is way easier than directly using HttpClient. 

#### Spectre.Console
* I honed my Spectre.Console skill in this project which i previously learned.


## FAQ

#### How to beautify the table in the project?

Answer I used the Microsoft.Spectre.Console package, which you can get for Nuget package manager. Install it and add Reference to your project.
