# ConsoleDrinks Application

	An application that manages restaurant drinks orders using a console-based UI.

# Given Requirements:

- [x] Create a solution for a restaurant's drink menu..
- [x] All the data about the drinks is in the companies database, accessible through an API.
- [x] Allows the restaurant employee to pull data from any drink in the database.
- [x] Create an user-friendly way to present the data to the users.
- [x] When the users open the application, they should be presented with the Drinks Category Menu and invited
    to choose a category. Then they'll have the chance to choose a drink and see information about it.
- [x] When the users visualise the drink detail, there shouldn't be any properties with empty values

# Features

* Third-party API integration

	- The application uses a third-party API to fetch data about drinks.
	- The user can choose a category from the menu and then choose a drink from that category to view more information about it.

* Console-based UI

    - The application uses a console-based UI to interact with the user.

# Challenges

 - The biggest challenge was getting the data from the API and then displaying it in a way that was easy to read and understand.
 - There was another challenge which getting the image from the API and rendering to the console app in a pexilated fashion.

# Lessons Learned

-  I learned how to use a third-party API in C# to fetch data and then display it in a console-based UI.

# Areas to Improve
- The application could be improved by adding more features, such as the ability to search for drinks by name.
