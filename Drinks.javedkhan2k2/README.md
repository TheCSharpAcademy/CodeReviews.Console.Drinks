# Drinks

- In this Project Drinks App is created using
[Dapper](https://www.learndapper.com/) as
mini ORM.
- Users can select drinks category first and then select the
drink to view its details. From there users can add it to
Favorites, which is stored in Local database (Sqlite).
 This Project is a part of
[CSharpAcademy](https://thecsharpacademy.com/project/15/drinks) Console Projects.

## Requirements

- [x] You were hired by restaurant to create a solution for their drinks menu.
- [x] Their drinks menu is provided by an external company. All the data
about the drinks is in the companies database, accessible through an API.
- [x] Your job is to create a system that allows the restaurant employee
to pull data from any drink in the database.
- [x] You don't need SQL here, as you won't be operating the database.
All you need is to create an user-friendly way to present the data
to the users (the restaurant employees)
- [x] When the users open the application, they should be presented
with the Drinks Category Menu and invited to choose a category.
Then they'll have the chance to choose a drink and see information about it.
- [x] When the users visualise the drink detail, there shouldn't
be any properties with empty values

## Challenges

- [x] Add drinks to favorite drinks using local database
- [x] Show the top searched drinks
