# Drinks_Info_Application

Requirements

	• You were hired by restaurant to create a solution for their drinks menu.
	• Their drinks menu is provided by an external company. All the data about the drinks is in the companies database, accessible through an API.
	• Your job is to create a system that allows the restaurant employee to pull data from any drink in the database.
	• You don't need SQL here, as you won't be operating the database. All you need is to create an user-friendly way to present the data to the users (the restaurant employees)
	• When the users open the application, they should be presented with the Drinks Category Menu and invited to choose a category. Then they'll have the chance to choose a drink and see information about it.
	• When the users visualise the drink detail, there shouldn't be any properties with empty values
